## Introduction

AIStron is an open-source toolbox that provides current Amodal Instance Segmentation (AIS) methods. It is built as a project using detectron2 (version 0.6) and requires PyTorch 1.8+ or higher. The goal of AIStron is to combine the features of various AIS repositories and align them to facilitate easy maintenance and development of new methods.

Major features:
- Data pipeline: We aim to standardize the annotations of existing AIS datasets 
so that the methods can be easily implemented and generalized. This [diagram](assets/doc_imgs/aistron_figures-data_pipeline.png) 
illustrates the data pipeline of aistron

- Amodal Instance Segmentation Evaluator: AIStron helps compute the performance of both visible and amodal masks. 
If a method provides both `pred_visible_masks` and `pred_amodal_masks` in its predictions,
both performances will be computed. If only the conventional `pred_masks` are provided, 
only the amodal performance is computed.

- Utilities: We offer an amodal visualizer utility that allows you to visualize the ground truth or predictions with
option to choose between visible masks, occluder masks and amodal masks.
